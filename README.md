# PhishingAttackDomainDetection
Phishing attacks are like traps set online, designed to fool people into giving away sensitive information such as passwords or credit card numbers. These attacks often come in the form of deceptive websites, known as phishing domains, which impersonate legitimate entities like banks or email providers. Detecting these fraudulent domains is critical to prevent individuals from falling victim to these scams and to safeguard sensitive data. However, traditional methods of detection, such as using static blacklists or rule-based algorithms, struggle to keep pace with the evolving tactics of cybercriminals. As a result, researchers have turned to machine learning techniques to bolster the defense against phishing attacks. Machine learning offers a powerful toolset for detecting phishing domains by enabling computers to learn from data and recognize patterns indicative of fraudulent activity. One approach involves supervised learning, where computers are trained on labeled datasets containing examples of both legitimate and phishing domains. These algorithms learn to distinguish between the two based on features extracted from domain names, website content, and other relevant attributes. Another approach is unsupervised learning, which doesn't require labeled data. Instead, it looks for anomalies or unusual patterns in domain registration and hosting behavior, which may indicate a phishing attempt.
